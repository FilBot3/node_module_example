# NodeJS Module Examples

## Overview

This is a sample NodeJS Module that I'm using to demonstrate how to create NodeJS modules, then add in classes, functions, and test those things.

## Testing

To run the tests provided using MochaJS, run the following command in the Module's root directory.

```shell
npm install
npm test
```

## Development

1. Fork the repo.
1. Make a branch with changes.
1. Write and run tests.
1. Open Pull Request to upstream fork.

A lot of this initial work was a lot of intensive web searching for what I thought the term was, reading some more, then realizing I was doing it wrong.
